  title: 'AI->Human Communication: How to?'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Current AI->Human communication is ineffective because AI tends to
    generate dense, comprehensive outputs while humans prefer concise information.
    Investigating methods to make AI->Human communication more effective will improve
    human understanding and trust in AI-generated research outputs.

    '
  background:
    description: 'AI and humans consume information differently. AI works best when
      given dense and comprehensive information with detailed instructions, but humans
      like it concise. In the current surge of AI agent developments, it is clear
      that human->AI communication is most effective when the human user can clearly
      articulate their request, but how about AI->Human, especially when there is
      too much information to show? For example, with research agents, they read large
      collections of papers, code, and data, and possibly do some experiments on their
      own. In existing research agent works, the tendency is to generate thousands
      of lines of code and possibly a 100-page report. No human being will possibly
      read all that in detail, and to fully trust the AI-produced research work, we
      need to verify that nothing fishy happens in the middle. Imagine a scenario
      that you are joining some ongoing research project. It is likely not publishable,
      but there is some progress. How do you quickly onboard with what has been done?
      Or, you went for a break and want to catch up with the literature you care about
      (which probably has 100 new papers), how do you quickly catch up with all that
      information? These types of problems happen a lot with AI->Human communication.
      It may sound like a classic summarization problem, but it actually requires
      a lot of careful thinking about what are the most effective ways to help humans
      understand a dense source of information.
