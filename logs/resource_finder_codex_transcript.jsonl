Itsprimarygoalistoalignmodelbehaviorwithhuman expectationsandpreventundesirableoutputs(Christianoetal.,2017;Stiennonetal.,2020; Bakkeretal.,2022). Thisalignmentprocesstypicallyreliesondatasetscontainingprompts pairedwithrankedresponses,whichencapsulatehumanpreferences. Popularmethods likeReinforcementLearningfromHumanFeedback(RLHF)(Ouyangetal.,2022)leverage this data by first training a reward model to mimic human judgments and then using reinforcement learning(Schulman et al., 2017) to optimize the LLM policy against this rewardsignal.

Existingalignmentalgorithmscanbeexpensivetoalign for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data andcomputationforreal-worldusecases. WeintroduceGroupPreferenceOpti- mization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to prefer- ences of individual groups in a few-shot manner.

We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigor- ous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adapta- tion tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups,globalcountries,andindividualusers.

Many of these applications are inherently subjective and require generations that cater to different de- mographics,culturalandsocietalnorms,orsimplyindividualpreferences(Hartvigsenetal.,2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Solaiman & Dennison, 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020; Dunbar et al., 1997).
